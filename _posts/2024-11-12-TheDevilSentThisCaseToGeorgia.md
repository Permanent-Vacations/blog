## [Supreme Court rejects push to move Georgia case against ex-Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-mark-meadows-georgia-election-interference-876a332a9dbe1a89c50aecccee15952e)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to let former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows move the election interference case against him in Georgia to federal court, where he would have argued he was immune from prosecution.

The justices did not detail their reasoning in a brief order denying his appeal, as is typical. There were no publicly noted dissents.

@RalphHightower: Why should chief of staff get presidential immunity? He ain't president. Plus, the crime involved a state. The Supreme Court had said that Trump could be tried on cases that did not involve a president's duties.

Meadows was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia and accused of participating in an illegal scheme to keep then-president Donald Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election. Trump was also charged, though after he won reelection last week to a second term, any trial appears unlikely, at least while he holds office. Both men have denied wrongdoing.

Attorney George Terwilliger said Meadows will continue to assert his innocence in state court and expects to win an exoneration.

It’s unclear what effect the election results could have on others charged in the case, which is largely on hold after an appeals court agreed to review whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had hired to lead the case.

Meadows had gone to the Supreme Court in an effort to move the charges out of Georgia courts. He argues that the case belongs in federal court because it relates to his duties as a federal official. He pointed to the Supreme Court ruling, giving Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution to support his argument.

“A White House chief of staff facing criminal charges based on actions relating to his work for the president of the United States should not be a close call —especially now that this court has recognized that federal immunity impacts what evidence can be considered, not just what conduct can form the basis for liability,” his attorneys wrote.

But prosecutors said that Meadows failed to show he was carrying out official duties during the alleged scheme, which included participating in a phone call where Trump suggested Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could help “find” votes he needed to win the state.

They argued the case should stay with Georgia courts, and Meadows could raise federal defenses there. Prosecutors also pushed back against the contentioAd
n that the charges could have ripple effects on other federal officials.

“His references to the overheated words of opinion editorials cannot suffice to demonstrate that a new era of ubiquitous prosecution of former federal officials is at hand,” government attorneys wrote.

A U.S. district judge and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled that the case against Meadows and some of his co-defendants should remain in state court. A federal judge has also refused to move an Arizona fake elector case against him there to federal court.

Four people have already pleaded guilty in the Georgia election case after reaching deals with prosecutors. The remaining 15, including Trump and Meadows, have pleaded not guilty.
