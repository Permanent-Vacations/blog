## [Judge Chutkan Unimpressed by Donald Trump's 'Sneaky Strategy': Attorney](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jack-smith-tanya-chutkan-indictment-election-fraud-january-6-1959699).
Story by Sean O'Driscoll. September 26, 2024.

- **Judge's Decision**: Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Donald Trump's attempt to delay his election-fraud case by allowing a 180-page opening brief from the prosecution.
- **Trump's Indictment**: Trump faces charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election results, with the prosecution aiming to present comprehensive evidence early in the trial.
- **Prosecutor's Strategy**: The detailed brief aims to address all immunity challenges upfront, preventing mid-trial objections.
- **Political Implications**: The prosecution's evidence could be damaging for Trump during the presidential election season.

In her order, Judge Chutkan wrote: "The rest of the nine-page opposition rehashes Defendant's position that immunity briefing should not begin until he files a motion to dismiss several months from now. The court has already addressed the scheduling objections Defendant raised when he was given an opportunity to do so."
