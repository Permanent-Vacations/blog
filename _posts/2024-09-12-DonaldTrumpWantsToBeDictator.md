## [Why Trump’s comments about ABC’s broadcast license matter](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-comments-abcs-broadcast-license-matter-rcna170786)

It is no surprise that Trump holds admires strong-arm dictators, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un[^11], and Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary. Putin is former KGB; he knows how to control people. Flattering Trump will get you anything you want.

[^12]: The Republican Party ceased to exist in 2016 when it chose the most unqualified candidate, Trump, as its presidential candidate during their July July 2016 national  convention convention.
