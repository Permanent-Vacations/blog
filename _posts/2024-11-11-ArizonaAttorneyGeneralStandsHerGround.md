## [Arizona AG Sends Warning to Donald Trump's Allies: 'Won't Be Cowed'](https://www.newsweek.com/arizona-attorney-general-kris-mayes-donald-trump-legal-cases-mike-davis-1983788)

Story by Jordan King. November 11, 2024.

Arizona's Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said she and her allies "won't be cowed" into dropping legal cases against Donald Trump and those connected to him.

Trump won the presidential election last week, despite the fact he is currently facing three legal cases to do with election interference allegations and mishandling classified documents. On top of this, he is appealing the Manhattan verdict which saw him convicted on 34 felony counts in May.

The president-elect and his supporters have long insisted that the legal cases against him amount to a political "weaponization of (the) justice system,"[^11] as his campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung has said previously.

[^11]: @RalphHightower: That weaponization of the justice system is okay when Trump does it.

Trump's victory has raised questions about what will happen with these cases, but Mayes has said: "We won't be cowed, we won't be intimidated and we never have been."

In an interview with MSNBC, Mayes said: "This is a time for patriots to stand up for our Constitution, for us to remember that millions of Americans fought and sacrificed and died for our Constitution. And just because, you know, I don't even know how to describe the individual, would say those disgusting things about the top law enforcement officer of the state of New York, just because they say those things doesn't mean we are going to stand down."

Here, she was seemingly referring to Trump ally Mike Davis' recent comments about New York's Attorney General Letitia James, who has repeatedly faced criticism from Trump and his allies for her role in convicting him.

Last week, Davis told the conservative podcast The Benny Show: "Let me just say this to Big Tisk James, the New York attorney general, I dare you, I dare you to try to continue your lawfare against President Trump and his second term because, listen here sweetheart, we're not messing around this time and we will put your fat ass in prison for conspiracy against rights."

Davis is a conservative lawyer who has been rumored to be a possible candidate to serve as Trump's attorney general or as White House counsel.

While responding to Davis' comments, Mayes turned to legal cases in her own state of Arizona, where a group of Republicans have been accused of falsely claiming that Trump won the state in the 2020 presidential election.

She said: "As you know, I have a fake electors case in Arizona and have no intention of giving that case up—I have no intention of dropping that case. A grand jury in the state of Arizona decided that these individuals, who engaged in an attempt to overthrow democracy in 2020, should be held accountable. So we won't be cowed. We won't be intimidated and patriots across the country must stand up for our Constitution; for what is lawful and we will do that and where we can."
