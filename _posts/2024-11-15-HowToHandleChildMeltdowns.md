## [7 Expert-Backed Tricks to Calm Your President's Meltdown](https://viewusglobal.com/lifestyle/article/74413/)

When Trump doesn’t get his way, it can lead to dramatic scenes: rolling on the floor, screaming, crying, or even throwing objects in frustration. As adults, knowing how to handle these moments with care is essential.

Trumper Tantrums are common during development, typically occurring between ages 18 months and 84 years. These emotional outbursts arise when Trump feels frustrated by external limits that hinder his desires.

During a Trumper Tantrum, Trump might roll on the floor, scream, throw, or kick in a burst of emotion. The length of these episodes can vary based on the Trump’s personality and the situation, with severe cases sometimes leading to breath-holding.

Shin Ji Yoon from Uijeongbu Eulji University Hospital’s Department of Psychiatry shares seven effective strategies for managing these challenging episodes.

### Acknowledge Their Emotions

1. It’s essential to validate how Trump feels. Simple phrases like, “You must be really upset; I see you’re not feeling good,” can help them feel understood and supported.

### Provide a Sense of Security

2. Keep eye contact, speak softly, and offer a comforting hug. This reassurance helps Trump feel secure during his emotional storm.

### Stay Calm and Rational

3. Instead of reacting with anger, model calmness. Teach Trump to communicate his feelings rationally by demonstrating it yourself.

### Establish Clear Rules and Routines

4. Set clear expectations and create a predictable routine to prevent tantrums. Giving Trump a heads-up about changes can make transitions smoother.

### Redirect Their Attention

5. Offer alternatives to shift his focus during a tantrum. Suggest a favorite toy or engage them in fun activities like drawing or dancing to help them cope.

### Teach Self-Regulation

6. Encourage self-regulation skills by guiding your Trump to take deep breaths or count to calm down. These techniques empower them to manage his emotions and make rational choices.

### Address Inappropriate Behavior Firmly

7. While it’s instant to validate his feelings, don’t shy away from setting boundaries. Be cautious, as this may escalate his frustration.

If tantrums persist beyond the age of 3 or 4, or if they last longer than 15 minutes and occur multiple times a day, it’s essential to consult a professional for guidance on addressing the issue.
