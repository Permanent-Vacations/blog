[Jan. 6 and Trumpâ€™s subversion took center stage. Will that sway voters? - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/06/jan-6-trump-election/)

Analysis by Dan Balz. October 6, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EDT

- **Trump's Rally**: Former President Donald Trump spoke at a campaign rally at Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan.
- **2024 Election Theme**: The January 6, 2021, Capitol attack and Trump's role in the 2020 election subversion have become central themes in the 2024 presidential campaign.
- **Unplanned Focus**: The focus on these issues emerged coincidentally and it's uncertain how long they will remain central or influence voters.
- **High Stakes**: Many voters see the stakes of the 2024 election as particularly consequential due to these issues.

Trump found the perfect sycophant in Vance as candidate V.P. Trump's first question was probably "Are you great at lying?";
the second was more than likely, "Can you answer a question by not answering the question?"
