excerpt: "To use their Storm Shadow, their SCALP and their ATACMS, you need a launcher, the missile itself and a satellite navigation system. For us, there is a simple answer, let's destroy NATO satellites and more specifically, the American satellites that fly above us. They could not prevent it, it would be a challenge for them, a real slap in the face because America has always declared that attacking its satellites is a declaration of war, by doing this, we would be getting back at them by saying, you want a Cuban missile crisis? You will have a Cuban missile crisis, with each strike (with American weapons), there will be a satellite on the ground."
