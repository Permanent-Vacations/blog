On April 15, 2015, Rachel Maddow reported on a Koch brothers-funded group called Concerned Veterans for America, and its leader Pete Hegseth, who were advocating for the privatizing of the V.A. Later, on March 28, 2018, Maddow reported that Donald Trump, having embraced the idea of privatizing veterans' health care, wanted Hegseth to replace David Shulkin as his secretary of Veterans Affairs.
