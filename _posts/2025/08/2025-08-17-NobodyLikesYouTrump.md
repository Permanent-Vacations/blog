## [New polling makes Trump‚Äôs claims about his popularity look ridiculous](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-polling-makes-trumps-claims-popularity-look-ridiculous-rcna225218)

*What‚Äôs the good news for the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/) survey? There isn‚Äôt any.*

Aug. 15, 2025, 10:59 AM EDT
By [Steve Benen](https://www.msnbc.com/author/steve-benen-ncpn433601)

After [California](https://www.ca.gov/) [Gov.](https://gov.ca.gov/) [Gavin Newsom](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/california-redistricting-gavin-newsom-special-election-texas-rcna225123) mocked [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs sinking public support, [Rep.](https://www.house.gov/) [Darrell Issa (T-CA48](https://issa.house.gov/) appeared on [Faux Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/) to defend his party‚Äôs president. ‚ÄúThe ultimate in false statements,‚Äù the [the California congressman said](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lwgu3ejnil2m). ‚Äú[Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs low approval rating? It couldn‚Äôt be higher!‚Äù

This is certainly the line the GOP is expected to toe, as evidenced by [House](https://www.house.gov/) [Speaker](https://www.speaker.gov/) [Mike Johnson declaring](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/weird-reason-speaker-mike-johnson-claimed-trump-90-approval-rating-rcna219651) on CNBC last month that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs approval rating is ‚Äúskyrocketing.‚Äù The Louisiana Republican added, ‚Äú[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/) had a story, I think a day or two ago, he was at a 90% approval rating. There‚Äôs never been a president that high.‚Äù

This is clearly what [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) wants to hear. Indeed, the [president](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) himself this week [published an item](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)/115022012587872496) to his social media platform that read, ‚ÄúWow! Highest polling [Republican](https://www.gop.com/) [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in HISTORY! Thank you.‚Äù

His missive didn‚Äôt include any references to any specific surveys, and for good reason: [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/), who has a habit of [making up imaginary approval ratings](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-generously-makes-approval-rating-defying-reality-rcna193139) for himself, was peddling nonsense.

The latest [national poll from Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/692879/independents-drive-trump-approval-second-term-low.aspx) found [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs approval [slipping to an embarrassing 37%](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-accomplishments-havent-helped-poor-approval-rating-rcna221135), and a new national survey [from the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/08/14/trumps-tariffs-and-one-big-beautiful-bill-face-more-opposition-than-support-as-his-job-rating-slips/) pointed in a very similar direction. From its analysis:

> *Six months into his second term, public evaluations of [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) [Donald Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs job performance have grown more negative. His job approval stands at 38% (60% disapprove), and fewer Americans now attribute several positive personal characteristics to him than did so during the campaign.*

The closer one looks at the results, the worse they appear.

- [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has said the GOP‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Big, Beautiful Bill‚Äù is broadly popular, but the Pew poll found only 32% of Americans approve of it.
- [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) [has said](https://bsky.app/profile/ab21.bsky.social/post/3lvnyxr3dtc2f) the public ‚Äúloves‚Äù his trade tariffs, but the Pew poll found 61% of Americans disapprove of his tariff policies (which is consistent with [several](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/polling-tariffs-trump-analysis) [other](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/12/donald-trump-trade-poll-00449708) [recent](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5353392-trump-trade-tariffs-unpopular-nbc-poll/) national surveys that generated similar results).
- [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) has said the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has helped improve his public standing, but the Pew poll found 70% of the public disapproves of the administration‚Äôs handling of the matter, and 63% lack trust in what the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) has to say about the controversy.
- [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) is even losing ground among voters who supported his 2024 candidacy: His approval among these voters has slipped from 95% to 85% over the course of the year.
- In terms of his personal characteristics, the number of Americans who see [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) as ‚Äúmentally sharp‚Äù has dropped below 50%, and he fares far worse on questions related to his ‚Äúhonesty,‚Äù his ability to ‚Äúkeep his promises‚Äù and his interest in looking out for ‚Äúordinary‚Äù people. 

What‚Äôs the good news for the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) in the Pew survey? There isn‚Äôt any.

[Issa](https://issa.house.gov/) might believe that [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)‚Äôs public support ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be higher,‚Äù but I‚Äôd remind the congressman that, as a rule, it‚Äôs pretty easy for presidents to have approval ratings higher than 38%. In fact, at this point in his term, there‚Äôs never been an American president, in either party, with less support than [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/).

I‚Äôm mindful of the argument that his approval rating no longer matters, since he cannot legally seek another term, but I continue to think polls like these are important to the extent that popular presidents wield more power, while flailing presidents wield less.

Indeed, it might help explain why [Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/) keeps lying about his dwindling popularity.
