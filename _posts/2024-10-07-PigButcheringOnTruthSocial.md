## [Truth Social users say they’ve been scammed out of massive amounts of cash](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/truth-social-trump-users-scams-b2625301.html)

- **Scams on Truth Social**: Users, particularly elderly supporters of Donald Trump, have been scammed out of hundreds of thousands of dollars on Truth Social[^12].
- **Types of Scams**: Pig Butchering[^11] was the preferred scam, although other scams involved romance schemes, where victims were convinced to send money for various reasons, including fake investments and personal emergencies.
- **Victim Stories**: Individual losses ranged from \$21,000 to \$500,000, with victims often being persuaded to move conversations to other platforms like WhatsApp.
- **FTC Involvement**: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received numerous complaints, highlighting the widespread nature of these scams.

One individual, a 72-year-old man, reported chatting with a “beautiful” woman on the site before being scammed out of $21,000. According to his complaint he did not tell his wife about the “blunder.”[^14]

@RalphHightower: There are plenty of big *"whales"* on Truth Social. Those subscribers who are gullable to believe the lies from that pathological liar that Trump is will believe anything![^14]


[^11]: [Pig butchering • Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_butchering_scam?wprov=sfla1): "Sha Zhu Pan" or Shazhupan, (Chinese: 杀猪盘), translated as Killing Pig Game, is a type of long-term scam and investment fraud in which the victim is gradually lured into making increasing contributions, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, to a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. They are commonplace on social apps. The scammer builds trust with the victim through online communication, subsequently persuading them to invest in a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme. The "butchering" or "slaughtering" of the victim transpires when their assets or funds are stolen.
[^12]: Truth Social is a social media platform that was launched by Trump after he was permanently banned from Twitter (B.M.)[^13] for inciting and encouraging the January 6, 2021 riot and melee at the U.S. Capitol to halt the certification of Biden as president and the peaceful transfer of power. 
[^13]: B.M.: Similar to the time periods, B.C. and A.D., B.M. is that time period of Twitter, *'Before Musk.'*
