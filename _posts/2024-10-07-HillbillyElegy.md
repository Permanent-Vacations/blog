## [In the heart of Appalachia, a distant cousin of JD Vance leads an opposing 'authentic hillbilly' movement](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-10-07/in-the-heart-of-appalachia-a-distant-cousin-of-jd-vance-leads-an-opposing-authentic-hillbilly-movement)

Story by Mackenzie Mays. October 7, 2024.

Five generations of Vances gathered in West Virginia last month for a reunion, singing hymns and swapping stories in a quiet park hugged by towering green mountains waiting to burst into autumnal shades of orange. JD Vance — the Republican vice presidential nominee who reunion attendees say is part of the family — was not among them.

- **Family Reunion**: Five generations of Vances gathered in West Virginia, but JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, did not attend.
- **Criticism from Terra Vance**: Terra Vance, a distant cousin and Appalachian activist, criticizes JD Vance for misrepresenting Appalachian people in his memoir "Hillbilly Elegy."
- **Different Perspectives**: Terra Vance argues that JD Vance's story unfairly blames Appalachian people for their struggles, while she highlights systemic issues and her family's hardships.
- **Political Divide**: The article discusses the broader Appalachian movement rejecting JD Vance's narrative and the political divide within the Vance family.


"He is surely too ashamed to face any of us. Judas Iscariot would have a warmer reception," said Terra Vance, an Appalachian activist who genealogy records show shares some ancestors with the politician.

She headed to her brother's house to watch the vice presidential debate. Inside, a golden "V" for Vance sat atop a living room mantel.

On the TV, Vance answered a question about the deadly hurricane that had just rocked North Carolina, by touting his ties to Appalachia — a community he said he knows "very personally."

"He has a Vance nose," Terra said as she pointed to the screen.

"Don't remind me we're related to him," her brother quipped.

Watching the debate and rooting for Walz, Terra Vance threw her hands up in frustration as the Republican candidate with whom she shares a last name defended some of his policies.

"Fact check him!" she shouted, calling JD Vance "a sellout" and "a method actor."

"Why have debates or elections if there's no expectation of honesty?" she wrote.

That kind of "intentional political deception" was a hallmark of those in power "in the coal camps my and JD Vance's recent ancestors occupied," she added.

In his memoir, JD Vance mentions his own family ties to the same clan and their role in "one of the most famous family feuds in American history.”

While Terra Vance leads a sort of political family feud of her own, she acknowledges a rare moment in the book that she agrees with: The Vances are considered "hillbilly royalty."

They remain at odds, though, over how to use that power.
