excerpt: "For generations this city and state were the world capital of automotive production and American automakers rolled one iconic model off the line after the next, the Mustang, the Corvette, the Pontiac GTO. I had two of them actually. I had that GTO. Oh, I thought I was the hottest guy around. It was crazy. We didn’t have all of the foreign competition then. You were so proud to have a Corvette. Oh, if you had a Corvette. I never got a Corvette. I tell you, I feel I was left behind, but I had my GTO. I was something, man. I’d put that top down. See, in those days I didn’t mind when the hair waved. I’d go fast and that hair would be waving, that blonde hair and I’d say, who the hell can take me? Nobody. Today, I’m a little more careful I want cover up that little area up there. It’s a little bit soft up there."
