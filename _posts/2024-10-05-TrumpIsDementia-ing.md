At the Economic Club of New York, Trump struggled when asked about making childcare affordable, Trump answered nonsensically:

*“Well, I would do that, and we’re sitting down. You know, I was somebody — we had, Senator Marco Rubio, and my daughter Ivanka, was so impactful on that issue. It’s a very important issue.*

*"But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I’m talking about — that, because look, child care is child care, couldn’t — you know, there’s something — you have to have it in this country. You have to have it. But when you talk about those numbers, compared to the kind of numbers that I’m talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they’re not used to. But they’ll get used to it very quickly. And it’s not going to stop them from doing business with us. But they’ll have a very substantial tax when they send product into our country. Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that we’re talking about, including child care, that it’s going to take care. We’re going to have — I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time, coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country.*

*"Because I have to stay with child care. I want to stay with child care. But those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I’m talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just — that I just told you about. We’re going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it’s, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers will be taking in.*

*"We’re going to make this into an incredible country that can afford to take care of its people. And then we’ll worry about the rest of the world. Let’s help other people. But we’re going to take care of our country first. This is about America first. It’s about make America great again. We have to do it because right now, we’re a failing nation. So we’ll take care of it. Thank you. Very good question. Thank you.”*

Mary Trump, acpsychologist and the niece of Donald Trump, has shared her analysis that the former president’s mental health is deteriorating after he struggled to answer a question on childcare. The psychologist argued that Trump is “dementing,” citing his appearance at the Economic Club of New York last week. She added that the answer was “gibberish” and the only thing that made any sense was the phrase “childcare is childcare.” She went on to slam the “corporate media” for not properly reporting on Trump’s answer, instead thinking that “they must translate Donald’s nonsensical ramblings into a version of the English language we can all understand.” Mary Trump argued that reporters were “imbuing” words with “meaning that is not there,” adding that it’s “deeply disturbing that somebody as unhinged and incoherent as Donald is allowed to run for the presidency in the first place.” The psychologist wrote that her uncle is **“demonstrably untethered from reality”** and that **“the warning lights aren’t flashing because nobody covering him expects otherwise. Surely a political press corps that spent months arguing that President Biden’s age rendered him mentally unfit, wouldn’t look the other way when the Republican candidate, the oldest person to run for president in American history, is not only old but decompensating before our very eyes. The difference of course is that Biden is aging while Donald is dementing.”** She said that Trump is **“frightened” and “desperate.”** Mary Trump argued that the former president is concerned that his very freedom relies on his ability to get back into the White House and make the pending federal cases against him go away. As she lambasted the media for its coverage of the ex-commander-in-chief, Mary Trump concluded: **“The American people deserve to know what we’re up against. We deserve to be told that there’s a maniac on the loose.”**

On Saturday night, the former president vowed to jail anyone “involved in unscrupulous behavior” in connection to the election in November. “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again,” Donald Trump wrote. He added: “Please beware, that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.”

Trump has repeatedly threatened to use the presidency to enact revenge on those he believes have wronged him despite there being no evidence of the kind of fraud that he falsely insists lost him the 2020 election.

It's a constant whining complaint of Trump, *"It's not fair! It's not fair!"* when Trump imagines a perceived wrong done against him. But it is okay when Trump does it.

## ["Delusional and unsettling": Trump forgets there was no debate audience, claims crowd "went crazy"](https://www.salon.com/2024/09/19/delusional-and-unsettling-forgets-there-was-no-debate-audience-claims-crowd-went-crazy/ ).

*Appearing on Fox News, the 78-year-old Republican claimed that he won over an audience that did not exist.*

Not  only is Trump forgetting what the question was when he veers off topic and starts answering with gibberish, but he is now **seeing people** where there are none.

Faux News did not bother to correct Trump that there was no studio audience as agreed upon by ABC New and both the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign. 

Former President Donald Trump appeared on a taped segment of Fox News' "Gutfeld!" Wednesday, complaining once again that the ABC News debate moderators bothered to fact-check him while falsely claiming that the debate audience ***"went crazy"***[^21] for his performance. Host Greg Gutfeld chose not to fact-check Trump over the fact that there was no debate audience whatsoever, per the rules set by ABC News and agreed to by both campaigns.

[^21]: Was Trump saying that he ***"went crazy?"***

"They didn’t correct her once,” Trump complained, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. “And they corrected me, everything I said, practically. I think nine times or 11 times. And the audience was absolutely — they went crazy.”

MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes argued that the Republican candidate's remark validated concerns about his age and mental capacity.

"Trump talking about 'the audience' at the debate (where there famously was no audience) is more delusional and unsettling than any moment of Joe Biden misspeaking all year and it’s not close," Hayes wrote on social media.

About that scorecard tally of lies:

| Presidential Nominee | Total Number of Lies/Falsehoods |
|---|---|
| Donald Trump | 33, at least |
| Kamala Harris | 1, at least[^21] |

[^21]: The one falsehood he highlighted for Harris was her claim that “Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression"; the unemployment rate in January 2021, while high by modern standards, was the worst to begin a presidential term in the last 20 years, not since the 1930s.

## [Mary Trump Slams Media's 'Dangerous' Interpretations Of Her Uncle's 'Gibberish' / HuffPost Latest News](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mary-trump-donald-trump-media_n_66f41197e4b01c2b5008ec52)

The Republican nominee has fumbled through speech after speech on the campaign trail, delivering a stream of gaffes and word salad rants. Some in the media have vigorously sounded the alarm about his mental acuity, while others, such as The New York Times, have been accused of “sane-washing” the former president’s ramblings.

“The push to normalize Donald is breathtaking,” his niece Mary Trump, an author and psychologist, [said on PBS’s “Amanpour and Company”](https://youtu.be/x5U_IoJmJcs) Tuesday. “It’s as if the legacy media has decided that its job is not to report what he’s saying, but to translate it for us,” she added. “The problem is twofold. One, they’re not telling us that’s what they’re doing. They’re reporting it as if these are the things Donald is saying coherently. And secondly, they’re not really translating him at all, because his gibberish, really, is untranslatable. What they’re doing is they’re imbuing meaning upon his words that actually doesn’t exist in those words, which is much more dangerous.”

She said it’s “shocking” to see this treatment of her uncle, considering the “laser focus” that was placed on President Joe Biden’s age and mental acuity before he dropped out of the 2024 race. At 78, Donald Trump is now the oldest presidential nominee in U.S. history.

Mary Trump went on the program to discuss her latest book, “Who Could Ever Love You,” which unpacks her family trauma and its lasting consequences on her well-being, Donald Trump’s character and the country.
