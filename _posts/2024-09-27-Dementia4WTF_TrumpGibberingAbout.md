Trump Speech Takes Seriously Bonkers Turn With ‘Birds And Bees’ Twist
The former president's latest weird attack on Kamala Harris had critics buzzing.

Former President Donald Trump, the current GOP nominee, on Wednesday raised eyebrows and bee-wildered critics with his latest weird attack on his 2024 election rival, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.

Trump at an event in Mint Hill, North Carolina, repeated his allegation that his recent ABC News-hosted presidential debate against Harris was “three on one” because of the moderators’ fact-checking of his comments.

“I always have unequal odds but we handled it very well, we got great marks on that debate,” Trump continued about his performance, which included that bonkers, baseless claim about Haitian migrants eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. For the record, many conservatives said Trump’s showing against Harris was a flop.

Then came the wild tangent:

We had a woman debating. She just talked about, like, the birds and the bees. She didn’t talk about … when you asked a question, there was never an answer. There was never any knowledge. When you saw her the other day, and by the way, when she did the interview previous with the Pennsylvania person who was a nice person, I know him very well, they were the softest questions, she was unable, literally unable to answer the questions. We can’t have that. We cannot have it. We need four strong years, we have to bring our country back.

The former president then returned to his script, but not before critics on social media pounced on his rhetoric — in particular the “birds and the bees” line.

Donald Trump: “We got great marks on that debate. We had a women debating, she just talked about, like, the birds and the bees…There was never an answer. There was never any knowledge.”

## My Take

Listen you Trumpers, sure Biden is 81 years old. Yes, at the first and only debate with Trump, he seemed out of it. Many called for him to step down. He'll turn 82 this November. Trump puts together an endless stream of words, hoping that it'll make sense.

My mother taught high school English and she instilled in me the proper use of English and grammar. Listening to Trump talk is like listening to fingernails screech across a chalkboard. I'll read the transcript of his *"speech"* later. Even then, it still won't make sense. He talks like a five-year old; althogh hat comparison is disparaging to five-year oldsl

But your guy, Trump, isn't far behind. He turned 78 this past June. Campaigning against Biden four years ago, Trump was whining that Biden was too old. *Uh, Trump, have you looked in the mirror? You're where Biden was four years ago.*"

Now, I'm not talking about him being assassinated while in office even though there have been two attempts, where the first bullet grazed his ear, or the second at his Palm Beach resort doing what he is consumed with, playing golf.

No, I'm talking about the insurance actuarial odds of him completing the full term of office. Trump is in the twilight of his life. Let him do what he does best.

- Running his family-owned business, Trump Organization, towards its fifth bankruptcy.
- Running another company to its death, Truth Social. Watching it do a death spiral into the ground.
- Turning large fortunes into small fortunes.
- Playing golf, and cheating on his golf score.
