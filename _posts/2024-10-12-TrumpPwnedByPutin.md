## [Trump's close relationship with Putin could come back to haunt the US](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-relationship-putin-back-to-us-woodward-book-ukraine-russia-2024-10)

Analysis by Tom Porter and Hannah Abraham Oct 9, 2024, 12:06 AM EDT

- **Trump-Putin Relationship**: The relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has been controversial, with claims of a close friendship and multiple phone calls since Trump left office.
- **Ukraine Peace Deal**: Trump has suggested he could broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, potentially on terms favorable to Russia, which could have severe global consequences.
- **Economic Impact**: Experts warn that a peace deal favoring Russia could lead to global economic instability, including potential conflicts and market disruptions.
- **US Alliances**: Such a deal could damage US alliances, particularly with Europe, and embolden other autocratic leaders like China's Xi Jinping.

Trump may have had up to seven phone calls with Putin since leaving office in 2021, citing a Trump aide[^11].

@RalphHightower: I used the *"black hat hacker"*[^12] term, pwned[^13], to amplify the significant security risk that Trump is to America's national interest and security. Pwned is a term that black hat hackers use when they seize control of computer systems. Putin is former KGB. He knows how to cultivate resources for his use. With flattery, Trump will be at their control. 

[^11]: @RalphHightower: **What the fuck was Trump doing, calling Putin while he was a private citizen?** Trump did remove classified and top-secret documents from the [White House](https://whitehouse.gov/) at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.maralagoclub.com/) in various places like supply closets, and his bathroom. 
[^12]: A black hat hacker is a computer criminal who gains unauthorized access to computer systems and networks for malicious purposes. Black hat hackers are also known as crackers.
[^13]: [pwned â€¢ Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pwned): *slang* : to dominate and defeat (someone or something)
