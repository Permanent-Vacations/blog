##  [Trump campaign denies and revokes journalists’ election night credentials after critical coverage](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/media/trump-revokes-journalists-election-night-credentials)

Story by Hadas Gold and Kristen Holmes, CNN. November 5, 2024.

Now that a vengeful Trump is back in office, so go our freedoms. 

> I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.

At least, for us, the military oath of office is to defend the Constitution first. I hope to God that Trump doesn't invoke some law on the books that allows him to declare martial law

News Organizations That Had Press Credentials Revoked Or Denied:

- Politico
- Axios
- Puck
- Voice of America
- Mother Jones

It was probably Politico’s reporting that a Trump campaign field director was a White nationalist that pissed Trump off.

It's important to remember that Trump has a fragile ego and any negative news will cause a Trumper Tantrum.

Puck’s political correspondent Tara Palmeri was also set to broadcast from the event as part of Amazon’s election night special hosted by Brian Williams. But around the time Palmeri published a piece about “anxiety” within the Trump campaign, her credential was denied.

“I know I told you that I would be covering the Trump election night party from Palm Beach but turns out I have pissed off Trump’s campaign manager with my reporting and they decided to deny my credentials.
