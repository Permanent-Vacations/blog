## [Presidential Rankings Survey - Historians Rank the Top 10 Presidents / C-SPAN Survey on Presidents 2021](https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/?page=overall)

I took ex-president Trump's ranking from the table of all presidents to make it easier to read. Biden's term won't be assessed until after his term ends.

Interesting to note of Trumpâ€™s best ranking in the categories of public persuasion (32), economic management (34), and viosion/setting an agenda (36), Trump is still in the bottom third.

### Donald Trump's Rankings[^1701]

| Category	| 2021 Final Score	| Overall Rankings 2021	|
|---|---|---|
| Public Persuasion	| 43.9 | 32 |
| Crisis Leadership	| 26.5 | 41 |
| Economic Management |	42.7 | 34 |
| Moral Authority	| 18.7 | 44[^1701] |
| International Relations |	33.3 |	43 |
| Administrative Skills	| 22.8	| 44 |
| Relations with Congress |	28.6 | 42 |
| Vision / Setting an Agenda	| 39.6 | 36 |
| Pursued Equal Justice For All	| 27.6 | 40 |
| Performance Within Context of Times	| 28.3	| 42 |

[^1701]: Interestingly, Donald Trump ranks dead last in the category of Moral Authority.

Overall, Trump ranks 41 of 44, above Franklin Pierce (42),  Andrew Johnson (43), and James Buchanan (44)
