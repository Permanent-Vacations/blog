*Donald Trump has canceled a surprising number of interviews and appearances lately. The list is still growing, prompting questions from Kamala Harris.*

- Donald Trump was scheduled to appear at a virtual town hall with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) today at 2 p.m. — but it was canceled, with the organizers citing “changes in Trump’s schedule.” 
- Trump agreed to appear on CBS’s “60 Minutes” before canceling.
- He agreed to appear on CNBC before canceling.
- He reportedly planned to sit down for an interview with the NBC affiliate in Philadelphia before canceling.
- He was reportedly in conversations for weeks with The Shade Room about a sit-down interview before withdrawing.
- His campaign said he’d debate Kamala Harris more than once, but he soon after scrapped those plans, too.
- It’s also worth noting that Trump was supposed to participate in an event in Georgia with the National Rifle Association, but it too was canceled. The right-wing group explained that the change was the result of “campaign scheduling changes.”

As for the possible explanations for these many cancelations, Politico reported that Trump’s team told one outlet that the candidate’s schedule has been so busy that it’s led to “exhaustion.”

“Being president of the United States is probably one of the hardest jobs in the world.” Harris told reporters late last week, after referencing the Politico report. “And so, we really do need to ask if he’s exhausted being on the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?”

@RalphHightower: With the exception of Joe Biden, because his hair was already white, the presidency ages a person. Just look at the before and after photos of Bush (W), Clinton, and Obama. They all ended their two terms with significantly grayed hair. Trump, vain as he is, still has that Tang colored hair.
