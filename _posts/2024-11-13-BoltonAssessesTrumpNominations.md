excerpt: "“I do think there’s a group of people who think that they are going to be able to screen out people, not on the basis of philosophy so much as on their attitude toward the president. And the word loyalty is often used. I think that’s the wrong word. Actually, I think what [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) wants from his advisors is fealty, really a futile sense of subservience. And you know, he may get that, but I will tell you that that will not serve him well over the course of his next term, and it certainly won’t serve the country well.” – John Bolton, 
Bolton"
