## I Am the *"Enemy Within"*

Trump demonstrates his *Cry Baby attitude* when he whines that the [Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) system was weaponized to attack him. Trump is revealing himself to be the **Vengeful President** to attack his *"political enemies"*, and also destroy the First Amendment right: freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. 

But Trump exposes his hypocrisy by weaponizing the [Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) and the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) to do his bidding, instead of enforcing our nation's laws.

Besides attacking Americans and the press, Trump and Patel are bent on the destruction of the preeminent law enforcement agency.

### Kash Patel could be Trump's most dangerous pick yet
