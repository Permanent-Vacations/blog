excerpt: "Yeah, well, great to be with you. So it is a very complex threat environment and it's our foreign adversaries but it's also cybersecurity threats, it's physical security threats. The thing that I would want the american people to know is that based on extesive work by state and local election officials over the past several years, the reality is our election infrastructure has never been more secure. Whoever you vote for, you can have confidence that your vote. Will be counted as cast."

Forget the damned pathological lies and gaslighting from Donald Trump, and his sycophants, JD "John Boy" Vance (T-OH), bad Lindsey Graham [T-SC). Their strategy is based on fear and division. They are laying the groundwork to cast doubt on the election in case Trump/Vance loses.

The voting machines are not connected to the internet, so they can‘t be hacked by China, Iran, or Russia. I'm pretty sure that Trump and his sycophants, Vance and Graham will say that the Democrats hacked the machines.
