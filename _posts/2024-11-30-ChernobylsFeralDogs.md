## [Chernobyl's Feral Dogs Offer Clues to Radiation's Role in Evolution](https://www.dogclub.com/p/chernobyls-feral-dogs-offer-clues-to-radiations-role-in-evolution/)

Story by Angela Park. November 29, 2024.

- **Chernobyl Dogs**: Scientists are studying feral dogs in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) to understand how radiation has affected their genomes and possibly sped up their evolution.
- **Radiation Impact**: The study found distinct genetic differences between dogs living near the Chernobyl Power Plant and those in less radiated areas, suggesting potential radiation-induced mutations.
- **Broader Research**: Researchers are also examining other animals in the CEZ, such as bacteria, rodents, and birds, to understand radiation's broader impact on wildlife.
- **Future Implications**: The findings provide a basis for further research on radiation's effects on living organisms, despite challenges in distinguishing radiation-induced mutations from other factors like inbreeding.

Have you ever thought of how dogs in Chernobyl-infested areas live? Scientists have been studying them for quite some time now, causing new findings and remarkable indifferences compared with other dogs across the radius. Yup, amazing as it sounds, these dogs are a special kind, and it's an opportunity for scientists to discover wildlife's reaction to radiation. If you're up for such, then read along. 

On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor, located in Northern Ukraine and parts of the Soviet Union, exploded. It sent a massive plum of radiation into the sky. With that, every human evacuated the area, which is still a case nearly four decades after it happened.

Believe it or not, animals thrive in the absence of humans, which was proven by thousands of feral dogs that roam around the area. They were the descendants of the pets left behind when humans did a speedy evacuation. 

Now, as the explosion reaches its 40th anniversary, biologists decided to take a closer look at the animals located inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), whose size can be compared with Yosemite National Park. These biologists investigated how the decades of radiation exposure may have possibly altered these animals' genomes and sped up their evolution. 

### Animals Under The CEZ

The scientists from the [University of South Carolina](https://www sc.edu/) and the [Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) put the plan into action. They began examining the DNA of 302 feral dogs that were found to roam around CEZ. The aim is to understand how radiation has altered their genomes.

Co-author and dog genomics expert Elaine Ostrander provided an eye-opener for readers when she dropped these questions at the New York Times: Is there some kind of mutation that they've acquired that allowed them to breed successfully in the region, and What challenges do they face, now that they coped genetically? 

Radiation speeding up natural evolution isn't some new science concept. There is also the practice of purposefully irradiating seeds in outer space to induce an advantageous mutation. Its advantages include a well-worn method for developing crops that are suited for a warming world. 

Not only do these scientists focus on dogs, but they've also been exploring other animals that inhabit the area, such as bacteria, rodents, and birds. One study in 2016 found that Eastern tree frogs (Hyla orientalis), which are born green in color, were commonly black in the CEZ. Biologists theorize that frogs may have experienced a beneficial mutation that can only be found in melanin pigments. They help to dissipate and neutralize the surrounding radiation. 

### The Case of Chernobyl's Wild Dogs

With all that being said, scientists raised the question: Could something similar happen to Chernobyl's wild dogs?

The study found that feral dogs living in and around the Chernobyl Power Plant showed distinct genetic differences from dogs living 10 miles away from the inhabited Chernobyl City. This is one heavy implication that these dogs may have undergone rapid mutation or evolution due to their exposure to radiation. This is the first step in proving the hypothesis. 

According to one environmental scientist who spoke with Science News, the study may be a "tricky business" as sussing out radiation-induced mutations from other effects, such as inbreeding, may be incredibly difficult.

Still, the study provided a template for further investigation of the effects of radiation on other living things, such as the effects of radiation on other mammals. This is because the DNA of dogs that freely roam the Chernobyl Power Plant and nearby Chernobyl City can be compared with dogs living in non-radiated areas. Despite the lack of firm conclusions, the study has revealed that an area, even a wasteland, is an opportunity to understand radiation and its impact on natural evolution.
