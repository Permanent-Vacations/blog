Story by Ryan Bort. November 18, 2024.

- **Mass Deportations**: Donald [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) plans to declare a national emergency to use the military for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.
- **Immediate Action**: Deportations are expected to start within [Trump's](,https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) first 100 days in office.
- **High Costs**: The logistical implications of removing millions of people will be expensive.
- **Aggressive Approach**: [Trump's](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) administration, led by Tom Homan, aims to deport criminals first with a "shock and awe" strategy.

@RalphHightower: To **[Team Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump)**, I say “That’s FUCKING BULLSHIT! A National Emergency is to be used only when America is attacked!”

[Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) wants military boots on US soil, and I'm not talking about the [National Guard](https://www.nationalguard.mil/), but the [Armed Forces: Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force](https://www.defense.gov/About/our-forces/)[^31]

[^31]: Yes, the [National Guard](http://www.nationalguard.mil/) and [Coast Guard](https://www.uscg.mil/) fall under the umbrella of the [Defense Department](https://defense.gov), but generally, their focus is aiding the US; although the [National Guard](https:www.nationalguard.mil) may be deployed to foreign war zones. I'm not sure how [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) plans to use the [Space Force](https://www.spaceforce.mil/) against US citizens.

[Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) built his 2024 presidential campaign around a vow to lock down the border and forcibly - and violently - deport the undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States. He spoke repeatedly about an "invasion" of migrants who are "poisoning the blood" of the nation and even claiming that undocumented immigrants have been "conquering" American cities.

He's been insistent since winning the election that immigration is his top priority, telling >NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/) that his administration will spare no expense when it comes to deportation. "It's not a question of a price tag," he said. "It's not - really, we have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here. There is no price tag."

There will certainly be a price tag, however, and it will be high given the logistical implications of removing millions of people from the nation. [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]*https://www.ice.gov/) is not currently equipped to carry out [Trump's](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) deportation agenda, which calls for quadrupling the number of deportations the agency carries out every year.

Politico reported Monday on some of the tactics the administration plans to start cracking down, noting that deportations will commence within [Trump's](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) first 100 days in office, and that his team is looking for ways to expedite the process that will withstand any legal challenges from rights groups. [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) is also expected to quickly do away with a Biden administration policy that prioritized deporting migrants who threatened public safety and national security, and directed ICE officers to take "the totality of the facts and circumstances" into consideration before deporting migrants with criminal convictions.

Tom Homan, the immigration hardliner [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) recently tapped as his "border czar," has said criminals will be the first to go, while teasing the administration's aggressive approach to deportation. "I got three words for them: shock and awe," Homan told Donald Trump Jr. of the administration's approach. "Shock and awe. You're going to see us take this country back."
