## [Is The Great X Migration Finally Happening?](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/x-users-leaving-app_n_6737833fe4b02db5ae6c8d56)

Story by Njera Perkins. November 15, 2024.

[X](https://x.com/)may soon be dead in the water.

Two years after [Elon Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk)’s controversial takeover of the platform formerly known as [Twitter](https://x.com/), users are threatening to leave (again) — this time for good. 

It’s no secret that [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) has given X users numerous reasons to want to exit the social media app over the years, starting with the peculiar [“X”](https://x.com/) rebrand and reported uptick of hate speech under the [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) [CEO’s reign](https://x.com/elonmusk). However, [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk)’s involvement in the 2024 election — during which he served as a massive donor and echo chamber for [President-elect Donald Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump (and his Republican campaign — and new changes to his platform seemingly sealed the deal for many who have already declared their exit.

On Wednesday, Don Lemon announced that he’s quitting X after realizing it is no longer “a place for honest debate and discussion, transparency, and free speech” as he once believed it was, per a public statement. In an accompanying video, the former CNN anchor also mentioned alarming updates to X’s terms of service — which include directives that all legal disputes be “brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas,[^41]” beginning Nov. 15 — as another reason for his departure.

[^41]: @RalphHightower: Limiting where legal disputes will be heard is a sure sign of a predetermined verdict.

[^51]: @RalphHightower: I wish that I had saved a screenshot when I deactivated my [Twitter](https://x.com/)[^52] account.
[^52]: @RalphHightower: It was still called [Twitter](https://x.com/) back then. I revoked my account when [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk)](https://x.com/elonmusk) revoked [Trump's](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) permanent ban.

That same day, Jamie Lee Curtis posted a screenshot on Instagram showing that she successfully deactivated her X account, although she didn’t explain why.

Public figures aren’t the only ones denouncing their use of the X platform. This week,The Guardian told its readers it would no longer post content from their official [X](https://x.com/) accounts, largely due to [Musk's](https://x.com/elonmusk) impact on the “toxic media platform” and for using “its influence to shape political discourse,” which The Guardian said includes amplifying “far-right conspiracy theories and racism.” Add to that an influx of [X](https://x.com/) users seeking refuge on alternative platforms they deem less volatile than [X](https://x.com/), like Meta’s Threads.

But why the seemingly sudden change?

This isn’t the first or second time [X](https://x.com/) users have threatened to take their social media activity elsewhere. It’s also not the first time [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk)’s actions have contributed to [X's](https://x.com/) declining reputation. However, the deciding factor this time seemed to be Trump’s second election win, as anyone who was still on the fence about remaining on X took his victory as a sign to log off permanently. 

After Election Day, Similarweb, which tracks website traffic,reported that [X](https://x.com/) experienced a record number of users who shut down their accounts (roughly 115,000), marking the biggest drop since [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk) purchased the app in October 2022. Since then, a new platform has quickly gained popularity, [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), which functions similarly to [X](https://x.com/) but has more liberal sensibilities than its divisive competitor. PerThe Verge, about 1 million new users have migrated to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) in the last week alone, and the platform recently crossed the 16 million user mark, remaining No. 1 in the iOS app store. 

With growing fears surrounding [X's](https://x.com/) new updates and increasing right-wing rhetoric on the [Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk)-owned platform, some people seem ready to call [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and others their new social media home. But others are still not convinced that [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) is a viable replacement or are perhaps too accustomed to [X](https://x.com/) to consider switching over now, having spent years on the app. 

It remains to be seen whether this is indeed the end of [X](https://x.com/) as we know it. What is clear, though, is that a number of people still value community, meaningful connections, free speech and safety on online platforms, even as those principles seem to be decaying — and they’re determined to find them beyond [X](https://x.com/).

Good luck to those still searching. Long live the platform we used to know.
