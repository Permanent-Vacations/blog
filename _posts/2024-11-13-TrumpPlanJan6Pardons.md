But the move would further demean the rule of law to those of us in this country, and it’s not going to go unseen around the world. I mean, this is the type of conduct that, when viewed internationally, makes it impossible to distinguish the United States from a third-world country or, you know, a South American dictatorship. This is really lawlessness of the highest order, and there’s no principal basis for it. I think it’d be a very sad event.” – Ty Cobb, former White House Trump attorney. "

## [Ex-Trump White House Lawyer Spells Out Exactly What Jan. 6 Pardons Would Mean](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ty-cobb-donald-trump-pardons_n_67345561e4b0c06fd0e3e7f0)

Pence: "Trump should not pardon January 6 rioters who assaulted law officers."

“It is highly possible that Trump will go forward with these pardons. But the move would further demean the rule of law to those of us in this country, and it’s not going to go unseen around the world. I mean, this is the type of conduct that, when viewed internationally, makes it impossible to distinguish the United States from a third-world country or, you know, a South American dictatorship. This is really lawlessness of the highest order, and there’s no principal basis for it. I think it’d be a very sad event.” – Ty Cobb, former White House Trump attorney. 

Cobb also burned Trump over some of the people he has chosen to nominate for top roles in his second administration, such as Fox News’ Pete Hegseth as defense secretary. “I think we’re seeing a lot of Bronny Jameses and not many Steph Currys,” he zinged of the cabinet picks.

@RalphHightower: Donald Trump portrays himself as the "law and order" president, but that only applies to his political enemies.
