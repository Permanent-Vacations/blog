- **[60 Minutes](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) Criticism**: The show criticized several of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees, questioning their qualifications and backgrounds.
- **Trump's Response**: Trump's spokesperson called the show "unhinged" and accused it of bias, referencing past disputes with [CBS News.](https://www.cbsnews.com/)
- **Nominee Controversies**: Specific nominees like Matt Gaetz, Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were highlighted for various controversies and lack of experience.
- **Public Reaction**: The [60 Minutes](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) segment received significant attention online, with over 557,800 views by Monday morning.

Host Scott Pelley began the show by dissecting Trump's picks for his next administration, saying: "Some nominees appear to have no compelling qualifications other than loyalty to Trump."

Among the nominees referenced in the broadcast were Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense; Matt Gaetz for Attorney General; Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence; and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services.

- Gaetz. Had been "investigated by Republicans for alleged drug use and sex with a minor."
- Hegseth. Former Army veteran and [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com/) contributor, had **"no government experience."**
- Gabbard. Had been accused of having "sought a pardon on Edward Snowden, who leaked US secrets and now lives in Russia."
- RFK Jr. Skeptic of vaccines and the autism conspiracy theories

@RalphHightower: Well, it's true. [Trump's](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) picks were a **"What The Fuck Was He Thinking"** moment. The news media  with the exception of [Faux News](https://www.foxnews.com) are in agreement.

"The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail — and his Cabinet picks reflect his priority to put America First. President Trump will continue to appoint highly-qualified men and women who have the talent, experience, and necessary skill sets to Make America Great Again." – Karoline Leavitt, [Trump's](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) nominee for White House Press Secretary

"This is exactly why we rebuffed [60 Minutes](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) for an interview during the campaign. Their disgusting bias & unhinged 'reporting' are out of touch with everyday Americans who voted for President Trump. [60 Minutes](https://www.cbsnews.com/60-minutes/) is an outdated relic of the past. CANCEL!" - Stephen Cheung [Trump's](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) White House Communications Director.
