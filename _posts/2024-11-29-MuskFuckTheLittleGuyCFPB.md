Tech billionaire Elon Musk has sparked debate after calling for the elimination of the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \(CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/), an independent federal watchdog that protects Americans from financial exploitation. In a post on his social media platform, Musk wrote, “Delete [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/). There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” His remarks have reignited discussions about the importance of consumer protections in an increasingly complex financial landscape.

### The Stakes of Eliminating the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/)

Musk’s call to eliminate the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) aligns with broader critiques from some business leaders and politicians who view regulatory agencies as barriers to economic growth. However, dismantling the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) could leave millions of Americans without recourse when faced with financial exploitation. From protecting renters from unscrupulous landlords to ensuring transparency in credit reporting, the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) has proven to be a vital advocate for everyday people.

## Why Should Musk Care?

Musk is a gazillionaire.

Years ago, when I worked for a financial services company in Columbia, South Carolina, I got messages left on my phone from a zombie debt collector for a *Cole Brown.* It was always an automated announcing call, and since the calls were after hours, messages were left for the next day. Very seldom were the callers live.

One day a coworker, Mark, dropped by my cube with a question. Before Mark could ask a question, the phone rang. I reached behind me to grab the phone. 

Me: *"Hello"*
Caller: "Can I speak to Cole Brown?"
Me: *"No."* and I hung up.
Mark: "It must not have been a very important call."
I said, *"Nah, it's just a debt collector."*
The look, the jaw drop on his face, was priceless. 

Another day, a message from [Roper Hospital](https://www.rsfh.com/roper-hospital/) was left. That was my first clue to finding *Cole Brown.* Why would a Charlestown hospital be calling Columbia? Two different area codes. 

Hospitals can financially destroy a person. Using an online telephone directory for Charlestown SC, I searched for *Cole Brown* and found him. Same last seven digits as my desk phone, just a different area code, 843 instead of 803. I was prepared for the next time that a live person called. 

Eventually, a live person called. 

Caller: "Can I speak to Cole Brown?"
Me: *"No."
Caller: "This is ..." and rattles off my desk phone number. 
Me: *"Yes, we have three area codes."*, and hung up. South Carolina now has six area codes.
