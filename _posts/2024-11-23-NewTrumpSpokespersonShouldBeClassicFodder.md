## ['Shameless Lying': Trump Spox Put On Blast Over Bold Claim About The Media](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/karoline-leavitt-trump-press_n_673da6fce4b0060e54da72ae)

Story by Ed Mazza. November 20, 2024.

[Donald Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who will be White House press secretary when he takes office in January, is getting called out on social media for a bold new claim about her boss. 

“There is no greater advocate for a free and fair press than [Donald Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump),” she said on Fox News on Tuesday. “During his first term as the president, he was the most transparent president in American history. That continued on the campaign trail.” 

@RalphHightower: That’s absolutely total fucking bullshit!

world historical shameless lying. she'll be a great [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) press secretary

In the same breath, Leavitt claimed [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) “exposed the media for being incredibly hostile and fake.” 

Far from being a press advocate, [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) has attacked the media as the “enemy of the people.” During a rally earlier this month, [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) said any potential gunman “would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much.” 

He’s filed lawsuits against media organizations, demanded that broadcast networks have their licenses yanked over reports critical of him, and even reportedly tried to have late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel censored during his first term in office because of his jokes.  

[Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump) has also failed the transparency test, refusing to release his tax returns, as all other modern presidential candidates have done, and failing to provide details about his health, as other presidents and presidential candidates have done. 

Given that history, [Trump](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump)’s critics weren’t buying Leavitt’s claim: 

The ability to say this with a straight face is more impressive than any acting I’ve ever seen

Holy crap. That’s some world class revision of history.

Who did it better? 🤔🤔🤔

How does she lie so well with a straight face? Not even a little giggle when she states he’s been transparent! 🤪 Come on!!
