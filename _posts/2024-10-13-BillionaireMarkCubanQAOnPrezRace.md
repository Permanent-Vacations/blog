## [Exclusive: Mark Cuban on Backing Kamala Harris and His Concerns About Trump - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-mark-cuban-backing-kamala-harris-his-concerns-about-trump-1967910)

I deal with three types of businesses, the big ones, with say more than 100 employees. Subchapter S and LLC businesses and sole proprietors.

The biggest companies that are in oil and gas are more open to Trump. The rest I haven't seen many people get excited about him. Yes, they may prefer his lower tax rates, but the lack of stability, the possibility of tariffs, particularly hate tariffs like he threatened John Deere with and just the general uncertainty is a huge negative.

They know that Kamala is far more stable, open minded, she has done a great job communicating with business leaders, she is not an ideologue, she takes feedback from Republicans, independents and more.

She has also been clear that she will support and deploy new tech to make permitting and other government functions smaller and more efficient. That's been a big plus.

- **Mark Cuban's Support**: Mark Cuban, a billionaire entrepreneur, is vocally supporting Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, believing her policies are beneficial for the country.
- **Criticism of Trump**: Cuban views Donald Trump's first term as "bad" and warns that a second term would be "worse," expressing concerns about Trump's stability and policies.
- **Economic Policies**: Cuban highlights Harris' economic policies, such as "no tax on tips" and tax credits for new home buyers, as beneficial for everyday Americans and small businesses.
- **Prescription Drug Costs**: Cuban discusses his efforts to reduce prescription drug costs through transparency and efficiency, advocating for similar approaches in Harris' healthcare policies.

I found these two questions invaluable.

**Newsweek:** Many Democrats have said that democracy is on the line and Trump has threatened to arrest political opponents and critics. Do you think these are valid concerns and that Trump would follow through on those threats?

**Cuban:** Yes.

**Newsweek:** Trump is doing particularly well with men. Elon Musk, who you've criticized, also has a largely male fanbase. What do you think it is about these male billionaires that is so appealing to many men? And as a fellow male billionaire, what would you say to those men who admire Musk and Trump?

**Cuban:** The American Dream is alive and well. I admire Elon the entrepreneur. I also think Elon the Twitter (X) owner is a world class troll[^11].

[^11]: @RalphHightower: His comment of Musk being a world class troll on X/Twitter is insightful. Musk stated that X/Twitter would be a free speech platform. Instead, he's blocking and banning journalists who post negative, but truthful Newsom Trump.
