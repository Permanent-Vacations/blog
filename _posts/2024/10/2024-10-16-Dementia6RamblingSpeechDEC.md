excerpt: "For generations this city and state were the world capital of automotive production and American automakers rolled one iconic model off the line after the next, the Mustang, the Corvette, the Pontiac GTO. I had two of them actually. I had that GTO. Oh, I thought I was the hottest guy around. It was crazy. We didn’t have all of the foreign competition then. You were so proud to have a Corvette. Oh, if you had a Corvette. I never got a Corvette. I tell you, I feel I was left behind, but I had my GTO. I was something, man. I’d put that top down. See, in those days I didn’t mind when the hair waved. I’d go fast and that hair would be waving, that blonde hair and I’d say, who the hell can take me? Nobody. Today, I’m a little more careful I want cover up that little area up there. It’s a little bit soft up there. These things were coming cylinders, no wings, no nothing, and they’re coming down very slowly, landing on a raft in the middle of the ocean someplace with a circle. Boom. Reminded me of the Biden circles that he used to have, right? He’d have eight circles and he couldn’t fill them up. But then I heard he beat us with the popular vote. I don’t know. I don’t know. Couldn’t fill up the eight circles. I always loved those circles. They were so beautiful. They were so beautiful to look at. In fact, the person that did them, that was the best thing about his… the level of that circle was great, but they couldn’t get people. So they used to have the press stand in those circles because they couldn’t get the people. Then I heard we lost. Oh, we lost. No, we’re never going to let that happen again. But we’ve been abused by other countries. We’ve been abused by our own politicians, really more than other countries. I can’t blame them. We’ve been abused by people that represent us in this country."

## Briefly

@RalphHightower: Donald Trump gave a rambling two hour *"speech"* at the Detroit Economic Club meeting on October 10, 2024. I'll let you see if his *"tossed salad of words"* makes any sense.
