excerpt: To every Republican supporting her, what the hell are you doing? You’re supporting the most radical nominee in the history of American politics. What are you doing? You’re trying to convince me that Donald Trump’s rhetoric is the danger to this country? The danger to this country is the policies of Biden and Harris. Her fingerprints are all over this disaster. And I can’t take four more years of this crap. When you support her, you’re supporting four more years of garbage policy. So what the hell are you doing as a Republican, blessing this stuff? – Senator Lindsey (T-SC) on Meet The Press 10/20/2024. Maybe they want to return to normalcy – @RalphHightower'

1. Do you remember saying after the January 6, 2021 insurrection, "That's it! I'm done with Trump!"
2. How long was it before you and Trump were golfing buddies again?
3. Maybe your fellow Trumpers don't want to live fearing the *"Wrath of Trump"*
4. Maybe they don't won't to see this nation destroyed.
5. Maybe they believe that the Constitution needs to be preserved.
6. Revive the Republican Party from the dead?

### The Difference Between Republicans and Trumpers:

- Republicans choose **Country Over Party.**
- Trumper choose _Party Over Country._

[^71]: @RalphHightower: Maybe those true Republicans, not Trumpers, are choosing **Country Over Party!**

“To General Milley, you have a right to your opinion, but I don’t fear Donald Trump,” [Graham (T-SC)](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/) said in the interview, in response to Milley’s remarks. “I fear what’s going on in the world today. If you want the world to stay on fire, vote for her.”

@RalphHightower: This update is post-election (2024-11-20):

- Prior to the election, I was concerned about Democracy. 
- After the election, I fear for Democracy.
