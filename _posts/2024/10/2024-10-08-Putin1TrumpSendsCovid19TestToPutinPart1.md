## [Bob Woodward’s new book ‘War’ reports Trump gave Putin covid tests in 2020 - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/08/bob-woodward-new-book-war-trump-putin-biden/)

- **Allegations**: A new book by Bob Woodward claims that former President Donald Trump sent Covid-19 testing devices to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the pandemic.
- **Harris's Criticism**: Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Trump for this action, calling him unfit for office and accusing him of being manipulated by authoritarian leaders.
- **Trump Campaign's Response**: The Trump campaign denied the allegations, calling the book's stories false and biased[^11].
- **Media Blitz**: Harris's comments were part of a media campaign to amplify her message and address the tight race with Trump.

Trump demonstrated during his term as president, 1/2017 - 1/2021, that he is friends
with our enemies and that our allies are enemies. Were you still trying to put your name on a building in Russia?

[^11]: I trust a respected journalist like Bob Woodward, who helped bring down a presidency and chronicled the events of Watergate in *All the President's Men.* Trump is nothing more than a pathological liar. Richard Nixon almost the nation to a constitutional crisis. The conservative justices on today's Supreme Court are in Trump’s back pocket.
