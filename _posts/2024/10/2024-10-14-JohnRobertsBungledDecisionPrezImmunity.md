Here are the key points from the page:

- **Roberts' Challenges**: Chief Justice John Roberts faces significant political challenges, especially related to decisions involving former President Donald Trump.
- **Court's Political Entanglement**: The Supreme Court is deeply involved in politics, with Roberts' decisions often aligning with GOP interests.
- **Public Perception**: The court's favorability has declined, with fewer than half of Americans holding a positive view.
- **Upcoming Cases**: Major cases on transgender rights, gun control, and the death penalty are on the docket, along with potential election litigation.

@RalphHightower: By todayâ€™s politicized Supreme Court, and spineless Attorney Generals of today, Richard Nixon would be found innocent. Nixon kept firing his Attorney Generals, or they resigned instead of doing his orders.

About Trump's **Call to Action** to summon your insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, your call to "be wild" is in Wikipedia. There will be no "here say" about "that never happened."
