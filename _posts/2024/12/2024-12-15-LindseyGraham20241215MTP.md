excerpt: ''“So what do I want in an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, someone that can get back to the job of fighting climb and don't have your thumb on the political scale and make sure it's not used as a political weapon against people that you have a beef with. We don't want to go back to the days of J. Edgar Hoover and what we want to do is have an umpire that calls balls and strikes, and it will take someone to clean out the place.” – Sen. Lindsey Graham (T-SC)"

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) joins Meet the Press to discuss President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks and their likelihood of getting confirmed. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders talks to Kristen Welker about President Joe Biden’s pardon of his son and potential preemptive pardons for members of the Jan. 6 committee. Debra Tice discusses her son and American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared in Syria more than a decade ago. Amna Nawaz, Ryan Nobles, Ashley Etienne and Peggy Noonan join the Meet the Press roundtable.

So what do I want in an [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/) director, someone that can get back to the job of fighting climb and don't have your thumb on the political scale and make sure it's not used as a political weapon against people that you have a beef with. We don't want to go back to the days of J. Edgar Hoover and what we want to do is have an umpire that calls balls and strikes, and it will take someone to clean out the place.
