Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon suggested that President-elect Donald Trump could seek a third term in office.

Bannon, host of the War Room podcast, made the claim during a speech at the New York Young Republican Club's annual gala on Sunday evening.

The top Trump ally appeared to reference the wording of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which states, "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice." Bannon said Republican lawyer Mike Davis, who was reportedly in line for the role of attorney general, noted that the Constitution does not specify whether this applies only to consecutive terms.

“Donald John Trump is going to raise his hand on the King James Bible and take the oath of office, his third victory and his second term.And the viceroy Mike Davis tells me, since it doesn't actually say consecutive, that, I don't know, maybe we do it again in '28? Are you guys down for that? Trump '28?” – Bannon,former criminal (four months prison sentence), former Trump puppeteer.

The 22<sup>nd</sup> Amendment was ratified in 1951 following the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms between 1933 and 1945. Congress pushed for a two-term limit for presidents due to concerns about abuse of power.

Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, warned that Trump would attempt to act as an authoritarian figure if he returned to the White House. During the 2024 campaign, Harris agreed with the suggestion that Trump is a "fascist" and told voters he vowed to be a "dictator" if elected back to office.

Newsweek has contacted Bannon, Davis' office and Trump's transition team for comment via email.

The Constitution states that a person cannot be elected president more than twice. Trump will officially begin his second term as president upon his inauguration on January 20, 2025.

There is an exception that allows for a person to serve more than two terms, but only under specific circumstances. A vice president who ascends to the presidency through succession, such as if the incumbent dies or resigns, could seek two additional terms if their initial presidency lasted less than two years.

The president-elect rejected the idea of repealing the 22nd Amendment during an interview with Time magazine in April.

"I wouldn't be in favor of a challenge. Not for me. I wouldn't be in favor of it at all," Trump said. "I intend to serve four years and do a great job."

But, during a speech at the National Rifle Association annual meeting in May, Trump had said: "You know, FDR, 16 years—almost 16 years—he was four terms. I don't know, are we going to be considered three-term? Or two-term?"

Trump is also said to have jokingly suggested to House Republicans on November 13 that he will not run again in 2028 "unless you do something," according to The Hill.

Bannon was White House chief strategist during the Trump administration's first seven months. He recently served a four-month prison sentence after he was found guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress. He was released in October.
