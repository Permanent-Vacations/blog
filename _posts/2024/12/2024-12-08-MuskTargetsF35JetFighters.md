Elon Musk, now leading the Department of Government Efficiency, is targeting the military’s costly F-35 fighter jet program. Musk called manned fighter jets outdated, arguing that drones are the future of warfare and a smarter investment for national defense. 

Musk’s comments, made on his social media platform, X, took aim at the F-35 program, which is over $180 billion above budget and more than a decade behind schedule.

Calling it the “worst military value for money in history,” Musk advocated for replacing expensive, piloted jets with swarms of low-cost, AI-driven drones.

While his remarks caused Lockheed Martin’s stock to fall by 3%, they have sparked debate over whether the F-35 is an indispensable weapon or an outdated relic of 1990s defense planning. 

The F-35, developed by Lockheed Martin, is the most advanced fighter jet in the U.S. arsenal but has faced criticism for its steep costs and technical issues. Despite its troubled history, over 1,000 jets have been delivered, and in training scenarios, the F-35 demonstrated a 20-to-1 kill ratio against enemy aircraft.

Musk dismissed the program’s stealth technology, saying it is increasingly vulnerable to modern AI and infrared detection systems. 

Drones, Musk argued, are the better alternative. Small drones used in the Russia-Ukraine conflict cost $10,000 to $50,000 each, compared to the F-35’s $80 million price tag. Drones also eliminate the risks to pilots and can operate in swarms, performing coordinated missions with minimal human oversight.

If Musk succeeds in steering the Pentagon toward drones, Silicon Valley companies like Anduril, Shield AI and Palantir could see major opportunities. Meanwhile, defense industry giants like Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon may face disruptions to their traditional business models. 

Musk’s vision has drawn criticism and support, leaving the future of U.S. airpower at a crossroads as defense spending for 2024 already tops $840 billion.
