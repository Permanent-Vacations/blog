## ['Come on, that's not really serious': Legal expert blows off Trump lawyer's latest plea](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-letitia-james-2670454178/)

Story by Tom Boggioni. December 14, 2024.

- **Trump's Civil Fraud Conviction**: Donald Trump was found guilty of business fraud and fined $364 million.
- **Legal Appeals**: Trump's lawyers have made multiple unsuccessful appeals to dismiss the case.
- **Attorney General's Stance**: New York Attorney General Letitia James has firmly rejected dismissing the civil case.
- **Legal Precedent**: The Supreme Court allows civil litigation to proceed against sitting presidents.

Appearing on MSNBC's "The Katie Phang Show" on Saturday, a former Southern District of New York prosecutor all but rolled her eyes when asked a long-shot bid from one of Donald Trump's lawyers to get his client's civil fraud conviction tossed with a plea to New York Attorney General Letitia "Tish" James.

Speaking with Phang, herself also a former prosecutor, attorney Kristy Greenberg explained that there is no reason for the president-elect's civil trials to be dismissed in the same way his federal trials were dropped after he won re-election.

That brought them to the ruling in Judge Arthur Engoron's courtroom where the Trump was found to have committed business fraud and was walloped with a $364 million penalty for ill-gotten gains.

As host Phang pointed out, Trump's attorneys have been making multiple appeals to get everything tossed, with no luck so far.

'Talk about Tish James and her response when she said 'Nah, we are not going to voluntarily dismiss this because it is civil case' and the law is legion when it comes to saying you can pursue civil remedies and civil actions against sitting presidents," host Phang prompted her guest.

"Right, I mean, the law there is very clear. She deals with the law which is clear this case is not going anywhere. It is fully briefed on appeal, we will see what the appellate court does. The Supreme Court has said if you are talking about civil litigation, that can go on even while he is sitting as president–– the law is crystal clear there. She cites it and she doesn't get into the back and forth with Trump's lawyer where his letter is saying what about unity, we need unity for the country? And her response doesn't even address that because come on, that's not really serious." – Kristy Greenberg

Donald Trump's lawyers are urging a New York judge to make his hush money conviction go away, claiming prosecutors' suggestion to abate the case is 'irresponsible'. Kristy Greenberg and Katie Phang break down the latest in Trump's legal cases.

@RalphHightower: In the MSNBC video, Katie Greenberg states that Trump’s attorneys are putting political rhetoric in their court documents which is completely inappropriate.
