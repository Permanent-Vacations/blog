In this episode, Mary Trump dissects Donald Trump’s recent interview after being named Time magazine's Person of the Year, a title that doesn’t signify good character, but rather influence. She criticizes his continued lies about the 2020 election, his disastrous economic promises, and his inability to accept any responsibility for his failures. Tune in for Mary's biting commentary on how Trump manipulates the media, disregards facts, and pushes an agenda of personal gain, all while surrounding himself with sycophants and pushing for unchecked power.
