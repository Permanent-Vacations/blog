## [Antimatter rocket 300x stronger than fusion could reach nearby stars within days: Study](https://interestingengineering.com/space/antimatter-rocket-engine-300x-stronger)

- **Antimatter Propulsion**: Scientists are exploring antimatter propulsion for interstellar travel due to its high energy potential.
- **Annihilation Reactions**: Two specific reactions are highlighted: antiproton-nucleon and positron-electron annihilation, both offering stability and significant energy release.
- **Energy Density**: Antimatter annihilation releases energy density of \(9 \times 10^{16}\) J/kg, making it vastly more powerful than current propulsion methods.
- **Challenges**: Producing and storing antimatter, particularly antihydrogen, remains difficult and expensive, limiting its current feasibility for space travel.

Scientists are exploring the possibilities of antimatter propulsion as they try to achieve interstellar travel.

While conventional rockets provide high thrust, they struggle with low efficiency. Conversely, electric propulsion and solar sails offer high efficiency but generate minimal thrust.

It is in this regard that scientists are looking toward a theoretical solution that harnesses the immense energy of antimatter.

“Antimatter propulsion is a groundbreaking technology with potential to transform space exploration, enabling travel to distant locations once deemed impossible,” asserted a new study by researchers from the United Arab Emirates University.

“Spacecrafts can traverse the Solar System to reach nearby stars in a span of days to weeks (within a human lifetime) due to this enormous energy potential.”

### Specific types of annihilation reactions

However, the diverse range of potential matter-antimatter reactions presents a significant challenge. Now, the new study has supported the selection of two specific types of annihilation reactions that are particularly well-suited for space missions.

The first involves the interaction of antiprotons with nucleons, which encompass both protons and neutrons. Antiprotons are the antimatter counterparts of protons, and when an antiproton encounters a proton or neutron, they mutually annihilate. This reaction is characterized by its stability and substantial energy release.

The second suitable reaction involves the interaction of positrons with electrons. Positrons are the antimatter equivalents of electrons. Similar to antiproton-nucleon annihilation, positron-electron annihilation is also stable and yields a significant amount of energy.

The selection of these specific reactions is important because many antimatter particles are naturally unstable. But for long-duration space missions, the chosen antimatter must be capable of being stored safely for extended periods. Antiprotons and positrons exhibit the necessary stability.

### High energy density and efficiency of antimatter propulsion

The excitement surrounding antimatter propulsion stems from its energy density. When matter and antimatter come into contact, they annihilate each other, transforming their entire mass into energy. This process releases an energy density of 9 x 10¹⁶ J/kg.

“To depict this magnitude, this energy, kilogram for kilogram, is about ten billion times more than the hydrogen-oxygen combustion that powers space shuttles’ main engines and 300 times more than the fusion reactions at the Sun’s core,” remarked the researchers in the study.

“Moreover, the specific impulse of antimatter can reach up to 20 million m/s, which is the highest possible, making interstellar propulsion a goal instead of a dream.”

Another advantage of antimatter propulsion is its efficiency. About 70% of the energy released during the annihilation process can be used for propulsion.

### Challenges in producing antimatter fuel

Producing and storing antimatter is difficult and expensive. Current methods yield amounts far below the quantities needed to propel spacecraft.

As of now, one of the most promising candidates for antimatter fuel is antihydrogen.

“Antihydrogen is the simplest pure antimatter atom. Its stability, long-term storage capability, and simplicity of production give it the potential to scale up its production and storage capacities,” explained the researchers.

However, the production of antihydrogen is still in the early stages of development.

“Although scientists were able to produce tiny amounts of antihydrogen, it is still a challenge to scale this up enough for spacecraft propulsion,” concluded the study.

Antimatter consists of antiparticles. These antiparticles have the same mass as ordinary particles but possess opposite charges and quantum spins. When an antiparticle encounters its corresponding particle, they annihilate each other, releasing their combined mass as energy. This is the most energetic reaction known in physics[^11].
