Story by Alex Nitzberg. November 4, 2024.

[Sen. Mike Lee (T-UT)](https://www.lee.senate.gov/) on X/Twitter: "Day 1: Nuke the filibuster. Day 2: Pack SCOTUS. Day 3: Make DC & PR states. Day 4: Enact federal takeover of elections/redistricting/campaigns. Days 5 - 36,500: Rule America uncontested for 100 years." Lee's been in the Senate since 2011 and has been responding to Harris on X/Twitter. 

"In the global struggle between tyranny and democracy, the President of the United States must always be on the side of freedom." Harris tweeted.

@RalphHightower: It has been the Trumpers that are using fear, sewing doubt on a fair election. Trump provided the playbook to attempt to steal elections.
