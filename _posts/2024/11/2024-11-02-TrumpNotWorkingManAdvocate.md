- **Trump's Policies on Poverty**: During his presidency, Trump proposed significant cuts to programs aiding low-income families, including health care, food assistance, and housing programs.
- **Project 2025**: Critics cite this as a blueprint for a potential second Trump term, proposing deep cuts to the social safety net and tax breaks for the wealthy.
- **First-Term Challenges**: Trump faced difficulties implementing his agenda due to inefficiencies and a lack of preparation in his early presidency.
- **Future Plans**: If re-elected, Trump and his allies plan to combine tax cuts with aggressive cuts to social spending, and to introduce new regulations earlier in the term.

11. Freezing Pell grants for lower-income college students so that they’re not adjusted for inflation.
12. Overhauling and substantially cutting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, colloquially known as food stamps, in part by defining people with assets exceeding $2,250 as not being poor enough to receive aid and reducing the minimum monthly food stamp amount from $23 to zero.
