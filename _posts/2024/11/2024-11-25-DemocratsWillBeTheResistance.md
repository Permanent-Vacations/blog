excerpt: "Democratic leaders finally take the gloves off to take on Trump's allies and destructive policies. Reps like Crockett, McGovern, and Jeffries unleash scathing rebukes, exposing the former president's disrespect for democracy. Governors have formed a coalition to shield citizens' rights and the justice system from Trump's authoritarianism. This is a stirring call-to-action as the left refuses to back down in the fight to protect American values."
