excerpt: 'What Donald Trump has previously done, which is sort of the account, because he thinks that he may be ahead because of the so-called red mirage. There may be less of a red mirage this time. If there is, what he previously did, they stop the account. Just to be clear, that is illegal to say that. That is a violation of the civil rights statute federally. You will hear exactly that thinking, if you can stop the incoming vote, it will cost the democrats to win. That is illegal. You have to count all votes. I fully expect that if Donald Trump thinks he is ahead at the start, and there are more mail-in ballots and absentee ballots coming in that will favor the democrats. He will be doing exactly what he has already done, which is to say, stop the count, and it is actually voter fraud. In fact, the voter fraud is saying, Don’t count the votes. You say, it is illegal to get up and declare-- stop the accounting, I won.'
