Flip/Flops:

- Bill Ackerman, billionaire hedge fund manager. Condemned January 6, 2021 insurrection, calling on Trump to “resign and apologize to all Americans.” Flip/Flopped in July when he announced he would endorse Trump. At the time Ackman wrote on social media, “We are in the midst of a perilous moment for our democracy.”
