They said, ‘Oh my God. That’s unbelievable,’ I had to say. We have women that are highly sophisticated here, but they used to look at Arnold as a man.”"

Trump praised Latrobe Pennsylvania's native son, “Arnold Palmer was all man, and I say that in all due respect to women[^11]. This is a guy that was all man. When he took the showers with other pros, they came out of there. They said, ‘Oh my God. That’s unbelievable,’ I had to say. We have women that are highly sophisticated here, but they used to look at Arnold as a man.”

[^11]: @RalphHightower: Yeah, yeah, we know that you have a problem with your zipper. Bill Clinton shares the same problem.

This is clearly a **What The Fuck** moment in Trump’s campaign.

If Trump's campaign were a movie, the MPAA would rate his rallies as **"X"!**
