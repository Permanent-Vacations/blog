excerpt: ''Well, next week the American people will decide if the next president will be Kamala Harris or if everyone at SNL will get audited. 
Former President Donald Trump, seen here being rescued after 30 days in a lifeboat, gave a press conference from inside a garbage truck with his name on it. And my favorite part was when he tried to open the door of the truck but missed. Oh my God, he looks as drunk as I'm going to be Tuesday night. Then later at a rally, Trump said that he would protect women, whether the women like it or not. For example, he's going to make everyone who's a danger to women wear an orange vest. And then during a rally yesterday, Donald Trump complained about his microphone and appeared to mime doing something very specific to it.
