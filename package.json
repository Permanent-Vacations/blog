  "description": "RalphHightower/blog â€“ This is my personal blog with a heavy anti-Trump emphasis, occasionally a post that's non-political. 2015, I assessed Trump as a stupid, effing idiot with severe character flaws. 2024 pre-election, I had concerns for democracy; post-election, I have fears for democracy. This blog is built with Jekyll 4.3.4. No code.",
