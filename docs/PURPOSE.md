## @RalphHightower/blog

Some voters are what I'll call "single-issue" voters. They don't look at the overall candidate. They're probably 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment (pro-guns), pro life, or women's rights. 

This year, I was a single-issue voter. I voted for democracy. 

Prior to the USA's 2024 presidential election, I had concerns for democracy. Post-election, I have fears for democracy.

I initially had a page on my website, Donald Trump Is a Fucking Idiot. But I saw that it would be unwieldy to maintain, so I switched to a blogging format to post criticisms in smaller chunks. 

This is my personal blog with a heavy anti-Trump emphasis, occasionally a post that's non-political. 2015, I assessed Trump as a stupid, effing idiot with severe character flaws. 2024 pre-election, I had concerns for democracy; post-election, I have fears for democracy. This blog is built with Jekyll 4.3.4. No code.

Briefly, Trump is:

- A pathological liar
- Cheats on:
   - business (recording *"hush money"* to porn stark Stormy Daniels as business expenses)
   - financial loans (inflates property values for better interest rates)
   - golf (more than likely)
   - taxes:
      - personal income
      - business income
      - property (lowers property value for lower taxes)
    - wives[^11]
- Narcissist

[^11]: Trump and Bill Clinton share a common problem. They both have problems with their zippers.<br />@RalphHightower: actually, his zipper problems are not a problem for me. I voted for Bill Clinton three times.
