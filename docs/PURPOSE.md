# Purpose / Reason

## @RalphHightower/blog

I initially had a page on my website, Donald Trump Is a Fucking Idiot. But I saw that it would be unwieldy to maintain, so I switched to a blogging format to post criticisms in smaller chunks. 

This is my personal blog with a heavy anti-Trump emphasis, occasionally a post that's non-political. 2015, I assessed Trump as a stupid, effing idiot with severe character flaws. 2024 pre-election, I had concerns for democracy; post-election, I have fears for democracy. This blog is built with Jekyll 4.3.4. No code.

Briefly, Trump is:

- A pathological liar
- Cheats on:
    - business (recording *"hush money"* to porn stark Stormy Daniels as business expenses)
    - financial loans (inflates property values for better interest rates)
    - golf (more than likely)
    - taxes:
        - personal income
        - business income
        - property (lowers property value for lower taxes)
    - wives[^11]
- Narcissist
    
[^11]: Trump and Bill Clinton share a common problem. They both have problems with their zippers.
